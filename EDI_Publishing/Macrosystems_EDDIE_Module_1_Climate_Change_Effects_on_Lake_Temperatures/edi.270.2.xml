    <abstract>
      <para>
  Climate change is modifying the thermal structure of lakes around the
  globe. Because it is difficult to predict how lakes will respond to
  the many different aspects of climate change (e.g., altered
  temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.), many researchers are using
  models to manipulate climate scenarios and simulate lake responses.
  Lake simulation models provide a powerful tool for exploring the
  sensitivity of lake thermal structure characteristics to weather.
</para>
      <para>
  In this module, students will learn how to set up a lake model
  (General Lake Model; GLM) and "force" the model with climate
  scenarios of their own design to test hypotheses about how lakes may
  change in the future. Once students have mastered running one climate
  scenario for their lake, they will learn how to use distributed
  computing tools to scale up and run hundreds of different climate
  scenarios for their lakes.
</para>
      <para>
  The overarching goal of this module is for students to explore new
  modeling and computing tools while learning fundamental concepts about
  how climate change will affect lakes. The A-B-C structure of this
  module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels
  and course structures.
</para>
      <para>
  This dataset contains instructional materials and the files necessary
  to run the complete module. Readers are referred to the GLM science
  manual (Hipsey et al. 2014) for further details on model
  configuration.

  MODULE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING Module teaching materials were
  developed primarily by C.C. Carey and K.J. Farrell to provide
  instructors of undergraduate ecology courses with a ready-to-use,
  adaptable module that could be implemented in a 3-4 hour time period.
  Parts of this module were originally developed for the Lake Modeling
  Module as part of the earlier Project EDDIE (www.projecteddie.org)
  suite of modules.
</para>
          <para>
  As the first module within the suite of Macrosystems EDDIE
  (www.macrosystemseddie.org) teaching materials, this module was
  developed to teach students fundamental concepts about macrosystems
  ecology, and how a macrosystems approach can be used to understand how
  lakes are affected by drivers that operate on multiple, interconnected
  temporal and spatial scales. As a secondary goal, Macrosystems EDDIE
  modules introduce students to advanced computational tools as a way to
  manage, analyze, visualize, and interpret high-frequency and long-term
  ecological data sets.
</para>
          <para>
  The specific student learning goals for this module are that by the
  end of the module, students will be able to: - Set up and run the
  General Lake Model (GLM) in the R statistical environment to simulate
  lake thermal structure. - Understand how GLM configuration files,
  driver data, and output files are organized and used. - Modify the
  input meteorological data for one GLM model to simulate the effects of
  different climate scenarios on lake thermal structure. - Interpret
  model output from GLM simulations to understand how changing climate
  will alter lake thermal characteristics. - Use the GRAPLEr R package
  to set up hundreds of model simulations that vary input meteorological
  data, and run those simulations using distributed computing. - Explore
  the application of distributed computing for modeling climate change
  effects on lakes. The module was assessed by volunteer faculty testers
  during the 2017-2018 academic year. Faculty testers provided feedback
  that was used to update and optimize teaching materials. Carey and
  Farrell also used student pre- and post-module assessment questions to
  gauge effectiveness of teaching materials for achieving module
  learning goals. Pedagogical specialists with the Science Education
  Resource Center at Carleton College assisted with assessment
  development and implementation.
</para>
          <para>
  UNDERLYING MODEL DATA The module uses the General Lake Model (GLM;
  Hipsey et al. 2014), an open-source hydrodynamic simulation model, to
  simulate lake temperatures and other physical limnology metrics over
  the model time period. The model configuration for this module is
  based on the default dataset included in the 'GLMr' package (Winslow
  and Read 2016), which allows the GLM model to be run through the R
  statistical environment. The default dataset is for "Awesome
  Lake," which is a simplified model conceptualization of Lake
  Kinneret, Israel. The representation of Lake Kinneret has been
  simplified in multiple ways for the purpose of teaching this module:
  for example, while Lake Kinneret includes multiple surface inflows and
  a surface outlet, those are not included in the Awesome Lake model.
</para>
          <para>
  The glm2.nml lake configuration file and the met_hourly.csv
  meteorological driver data file used in this module are from the
  default lake model files included with the GLMr package for R (Winslow
  and Read 2016), which are a simplified version of the
  "warmlake" demonstration model setup for GLM version 2.1.8.
  Variations of the met_hourly.csv file were created to simulate
  different air temperature warming scenarios; files appended with
  "_plus2", "_plus4", and "_plus6" have
  air temperatures 2, 4, or 6 degrees Celsius warmer, respectively, than
  the observed air temperature for each hour included in met_hourly.csv.
  The field_data.csv file consists of water temperature profiles from
  Lake Kinneret, and were obtained by the University of Western
  Australia Aquatic EcoDynamics research group
  (http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/).
