MODULE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
Module teaching materials were developed primarily by C.C. Carey and K.J. Farrell to provide instructors of undergraduate ecology courses with a ready-to-use, adaptable module that could be implemented in a 3-4 hour time period. Parts of this module were originally developed for the Lake Modeling Module as part of the earlier Project EDDIE (www.projecteddie.org) suite of modules.

As the first module within the suite of Macrosystems EDDIE (www.macrosystemseddie.org) teaching materials, this module was developed to teach students fundamental concepts about macrosystems ecology, and how a macrosystems approach can be used to understand how lakes are affected by drivers that operate on multiple, interconnected temporal and spatial scales. As a secondary goal, Macrosystems EDDIE modules introduce students to advanced computational tools as a way to manage, analyze, visualize, and interpret high-frequency and long-term ecological data sets. 

The specific student learning goals for this module are that by the end of the module, students will be able to: 
- Set up and run the General Lake Model (GLM) in the R statistical environment to simulate lake thermal structure.
- Understand how GLM configuration files, driver data, and output files are organized and used.
- Modify the input meteorological data for one GLM model to simulate the effects of different climate scenarios on lake thermal structure.
- Interpret model output from GLM simulations to understand how changing climate will alter lake thermal characteristics.
- Use the GRAPLEr R package to set up hundreds of model simulations that vary input meteorological data, and run those simulations using distributed computing.
- Explore the application of distributed computing for modeling climate change effects on lakes.
The module was assessed by volunteer faculty testers during the 2017-2018 academic year. Faculty testers provided feedback that was used to update and optimize teaching materials. Carey and Farrell also used student pre- and post-module assessment questions to gauge effectiveness of teaching materials for achieving module learning goals. Pedagogical specialists with the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College assisted with assessment development and implementation.

UNDERLYING MODEL DATA
The module uses the General Lake Model (GLM; Hipsey et al. 2014), an open-source hydrodynamic simulation model, to simulate lake temperatures and other physical limnology metrics over the model time period. The model configuration for this module is based on the default dataset included in the 'GLMr' package (Winslow and Read 2016), which allows the GLM model to be run through the R statistical environment. The default dataset is for "Awesome Lake," which is a simplified model conceptualization of Lake Kinneret, Israel. The representation of Lake Kinneret has been simplified in multiple ways for the purpose of teaching this module: for example, while Lake Kinneret includes multiple surface inflows and a surface outlet, those are not included in the Awesome Lake model. 
 
The glm2.nml lake configuration file and the met_hourly.csv meteorological driver data file used in this module are from the default lake model files included with the GLMr package for R (Winslow and Read 2016), which are a simplified version of the "warmlake" demonstration model setup for GLM version 2.1.8. Variations of the met_hourly.csv file were created to simulate different air temperature warming scenarios; files appended with "_plus2", "_plus4", and "_plus6" have air temperatures 2, 4, or 6 degrees Celsius warmer, respectively, than the observed air temperature for each hour included in met_hourly.csv. The field_data.csv file consists of water temperature profiles from Lake Kinneret, and were obtained by the University of Western Australia Aquatic EcoDynamics research group (http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/).
