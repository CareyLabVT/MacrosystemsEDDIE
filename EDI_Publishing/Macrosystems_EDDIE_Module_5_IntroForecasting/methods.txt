MODULE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Module teaching materials were developed by T.N. Moore, M.E. Lofton, C.C. Carey, and R.Q. Thomas to provide instructors of undergraduate ecology courses with a ready-to-use, adaptable module that could be implemented in a 3-4 hour time period to introduce undergraduates to ecological forecasting. 

As the fifth module within the suite of Macrosystems EDDIE (www.macrosystemseddie.org) teaching materials, this module was developed to teach students macrosystems ecology and ecolgoical forecasting. The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about ecological forecasting and build a forecast for a NEON site. Students work with an R Shiny application to visualize data, build a model, generate a forecast with uncertainty, and then compare the forecast with observations. As a secondary goal, Macrosystems EDDIE modules introduce students to advanced computational tools as a way to manage, analyze, visualize, and interpret high-frequency and long-term ecological data sets; conduct ecosystem modeling; and generate ecological forecasts with quantified uncertainty. 

The specific student learning goals for this module are that by the end of the module, students will be able to: 
- Describe an ecological forecast and the iterative forecasting cycle.
- Explore and visualize NEON data (Activity A).
- Construct a simple ecological model to generate forecasts of ecosystem primary productivity with uncertainty (Activity B).
- Adjust model parameters and inputs to study how they affect forecast performance relative to observations (Activity B).
- Compare productivity forecasts among NEON sites in different ecoclimatic regions (Activity C).
The module was assessed by volunteer faculty testers during the 2021-2022 academic year. Faculty testers provided feedback that was used to update and optimize teaching materials. Moore, Carey, and Thomas also used student pre- and post-module assessment questions to gauge effectiveness of teaching materials for achieving module learning goals. Pedagogical specialists with the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College assisted with assessment development and implementation.

MODULE WORKFLOW

Workflow for this module:
- Give students their module report ahead of time to read over prior to class or distribute reports when they arrive to class. There is also an option to download the report directly from the Shiny app. The report includes pre-class readings, videos, and a short pre-class activity introducing some current examples of ecological forecasts. Students will also answer the questions embedded throughout the Shiny app in the module report, which could be submitted to the instructor for grading if desired.
- Instructor gives a brief PowerPoint presentation that introduces ecological forecasting, the iterative forecasting cycle, and a basic ecosystem productivity model (~30mins).
- After the presentation, the students divide into pairs. Each pair selects their own NEON site and visualizes their site's data, which is used to build and calibrate an ecosystem productivity model (Activity A). The two students within a pair each build their own model with unique inputs and parameters to compare the performance of two different models for the same ecosystem. For virtual instruction, we recommend putting two pairs together (n=4 students) into separate Zoom breakout rooms during this activity so the two pairs can compare results.
- The instructor then introduces Activities B and C, potentially revisiting some of the slides from the introductory presentation as a reminder to students about the next steps. For virtual instruction, this would entail having the students come back to the main Zoom room for a short check-in.
- The students work in their pairs to forecast primary productivity at their chosen site using each model, and investigate how the forecast uncertainty changes with different model inputs and parameters (Activity B). At the end of Activity B, students assess their forecasts. They may also compare their forecasts with their partner's. For virtual instruction, we recommend putting the two pairs back into the same Zoom breakout rooms. Optionally, instructors may bring the class back together at the end of Activity B to discuss performance of students' initial forecasts before beginning Activity C.
- Student pairs then update their forecast models and generate a second forecast, thus completing and recommencing the iterative forecast cycle (Activity C). The students work together in a group to present the results from their site and different models to the rest of the class. The class may discuss why the forecasts are similar or different among the different sites and models.
