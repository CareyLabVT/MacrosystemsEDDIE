    <abstract>
      <para>
  Environmental phenomena are often driven by multiple factors that
  interact across space and over time. In freshwater lakes and
  reservoirs worldwide, phytoplankton blooms are increasing in frequency
  and severity due to interactions between local, regional, and
  continental drivers, including land use (local) and climate change
  (regional) drivers. Because it is difficult to predict how
  phytoplankton blooms will respond to the different aspects of land use
  and climate change simultaneously, many researchers are using lake
  simulation models, which provide a powerful tool for exploring the
  sensitivity of ecosystems to multiple factors.
</para>
      <para>
  In this module, students will learn how to set up a lake simulation
  model and "force" the model with climate and land use
  scenarios to test hypotheses about how local and regional drivers
  interact to promote or suppress phytoplankton blooms in different
  lakes.
</para>
      <para>
  The overarching goal of this module is for students to explore new
  modeling and computing tools while learning fundamental concepts about
  how non-linear macrosystem-level phenomena (e.g., lake phytoplankton
  blooms) can occur through cross-scale interactions. The A-B-C
  structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of
  student levels and course structures.

  MODULE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING Module teaching materials were
  developed primarily by C.C. Carey and K.J. Farrell to provide
  instructors of undergraduate ecology courses with a ready-to-use,
  adaptable module that could be implemented in a 3-4 hour time period.
</para>
          <para>
  As the second module within the suite of Macrosystems EDDIE
  (www.macrosystemseddie.org) teaching materials, this module was
  developed to teach students fundamental concepts about macrosystems
  ecology, and how a macrosystems approach can be used to understand how
  lakes are affected by drivers that operate on multiple, interconnected
  temporal and spatial scales. As a secondary goal, Macrosystems EDDIE
  modules introduce students to advanced computational tools as a way to
  manage, analyze, visualize, and interpret high-frequency and long-term
  ecological data sets.
</para>
          <para>
  The specific student learning goals for this module are that by the
  end of the module, students will be able to: - Understand the concepts
  of macrosystems ecology and cross-scale interactions, and how
  different ecological processes can interact at local, regional, and
  continental scales. - Simulate phytoplankton blooms in multiple lakes
  using ecosystem models of lake water quality set up with
  publicly-available high-frequency sensor datasets (Activity A). - Test
  the effects of a climate scenario on the different lake models, and
  examine how the timing and intensity of phytoplankton blooms change
  with climate warming (Activity B). - Examine the effects of both local
  nutrient loading and regional climate forcing to determine how factors
  acting at different scales interact to affect the intensity and timing
  of phytoplankton blooms (Activity C). - Predict how lake phytoplankton
  blooms may respond globally to changing climate and land use.
</para>
          <para>
  The module was assessed by volunteer faculty testers during the
  2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years. Faculty testers provided
  feedback that was used to update and optimize teaching materials.
  Carey and Farrell also used student pre- and post-module assessment
  questions to gauge effectiveness of teaching materials for achieving
  module learning goals. Pedagogical specialists with the Science
  Education Resource Center at Carleton College assisted with assessment
  development and implementation.
</para>
          <para>
  UNDERLYING MODEL DATA The module uses the General Lake Model (GLM;
  Hipsey et al. 2014), an open-source hydrodynamic simulation model, to
  simulate lake temperatures and other physical limnology metrics over
  the model time period. The GLM model is paired with the Aquatic
  Ecodynamics library (AED; Hipsey et al. 2013) to simulate chemical and
  biological dynamics in the lake. GLM-AED in this module (version
  2.2.0rc5) uses the 'GLMr' and 'glmtools' packages (Read and Winslow
  2016, Winslow and Read 2016), which allow the GLM model to be run and
  output analyzed through the R statistical environment. The module
  includes datasets for two lakes that are part of the Global Lakes
  Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON; http://gleon.org/), Lake
  Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and Lake Sunapee (New Hampshire, USA). The
  model representation of each lake has been simplified in multiple ways
  for the purpose of teaching this module: for example, while both Lake
  Mendota and Lake Sunapee have multiple surface inflows, they have been
  simplified to one inflow in the model.
</para>
          <para>
  Within the module, lake configuration files (glm2.nml, aed2.nml,
  aed2_phyto_pars.nml, aed2_zoop_pars.nml) have been coarsely calibrated
  for each lake. Meteorological driver data (met_hourly.csv) for each
  lake were compiled at an hourly time step from the North American Land
  Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2; Cosgrove et al. 2003) and include
  air temperature, short and long wave radiation, relative humidity,
  wind speed, and precipitation (rain and snow). Variations of the
  met_hourly.csv file were created to simulate different air temperature
  warming scenarios; files appended with "_plus2",
  "_plus4", and "_plus6" have air temperatures 2, 4,
  or 6 degrees Celsius warmer, respectively, than the observed air
  temperature for each hour included in met_hourly.csv. Simplified
  surface water inflow files (inflow.csv) for each lake were based on
  existing GLM model calibrations for Lake Mendota and Lake Sunapee, and
  include discharge volume, water temperature, and nitrogen and
  phosphorus concentrations at a daily timestep. Variations of the
  inflow.csv file were created to simulate different land use change
  scenarios, as represented by changes in the concentration of
  filterable reactive phosphorus (PHS_frp); files appended with
  "twoP", "fourP", and "sixP" and PHS_frp
  concentrations that are 2, 4, or 6 times the concentration in the
  baseline model. Each lake model also includes a surface outflow file
  (outflow.csv) that is based on existing GLM model calibrations for
  Lake Mendota and Lake Sunapee.
