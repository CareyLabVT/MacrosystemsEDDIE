    <abstract>
      <para>
  Ecosystems can be influenced by teleconnections, in which
  meteorological, societal, and/or ecological phenomenon link remote
  regions via cause and effect relationships. Because it is difficult to
  predict how ecosystems will respond to drivers from remote regions,
  many researchers are using models to simulate different teleconnection
  scenarios and see how ecosystems respond. For example, lake simulation
  models provide a powerful tool for exploring how lake thermal
  structure and ice cover respond to climate teleconnections such as the
  El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
</para>
      <para>
  In this module, students will learn how to set up a lake model and
  "force" the model with climate scenarios to test hypotheses
  about how far-away drivers interact with local lake characteristics to
  affect lake temperatures and ice cover in different lakes. The
  overarching goal of this module is for students to explore new
  modeling and computing tools while learning fundamental concepts about
  how teleconnections affect lake temperatures and ice cover. The A-B-C
  structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of
  student levels and course structures.

  MODULE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING Module teaching materials were
  developed by K.J. Farrell and C.C. Carey to provide instructors of
  undergraduate ecology courses with a ready-to-use, adaptable module
  that could be implemented in a 3-4 hour time period.
</para>
          <para>
  As the third module within the suite of Macrosystems EDDIE
  (www.macrosystemseddie.org) teaching materials, this module was
  developed to teach students fundamental concepts about macrosystems
  ecology, and how a macrosystems approach can be used to understand how
  lakes are affected by drivers that operate on multiple, interconnected
  temporal and spatial scales. As a secondary goal, Macrosystems EDDIE
  modules introduce students to advanced computational tools as a way to
  manage, analyze, visualize, and interpret high-frequency and long-term
  ecological data sets.
</para>
          <para>
  The specific student learning goals for this module are that by the
  end of the module, students will be able to: - Understand the concepts
  of macrosystems ecology and teleconnections, and how different
  ecological processes can interact at local, regional, and global
  scales. - Set up and run ecosystem models to simulate lake
  temperatures and ice cover in multiple lakes (Activity A). - Test the
  effects of teleconnected climate scenarios on the different lake
  models, and examine how local characteristics modify global-scale
  climate forcing effects on lake temperatures and ice cover (Activity
  B). - Compare the role of teleconnections in driving lake temperatures
  and ice cover across multiple lakes in different regions (Activity C).
  Predict how lake temperatures and ice cover may respond to changes in
  the timing and intensity of global-scale meteorological phenomena
  (Activity C).
</para>
          <para>
  The module was assessed by volunteer faculty testers during the
  2018-2019 academic year. Faculty testers provided feedback that was
  used to update and optimize teaching materials. Farrell and Carey also
  used student pre- and post-module assessment questions to gauge
  effectiveness of teaching materials for achieving module learning
  goals. Pedagogical specialists with the Science Education Resource
  Center at Carleton College assisted with assessment development and
  implementation.
</para>
          <para>
  UNDERLYING MODEL DATA The module uses the General Lake Model (GLM;
  Hipsey et al. 2014, 2019), an open-source hydrodynamic simulation
  model, to simulate lake temperatures and other physical limnology
  metrics over the model time period. GLM in this module (version
  2.2.0rc5) uses the 'GLMr' and 'glmtools' packages (Read and Winslow
  2016, Winslow and Read 2016), which allow the GLM model to be run and
  output analyzed through the R statistical environment. Calibrated
  models were set up for eight lakes that are part of either the United
  States National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON;
  www.neonscience.org) or the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory
  Network (GLEON; http://gleon.org). The eight lakes are Barco Lake
  (Florida, USA), Crampton Lake (Wisconsin, USA), Falling Creek
  Reservoir (Virginia, USA), Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA), Lake Sunapee
  (New Hampshire, USA), Prairie Pothole (North Dakota, USA), Suggs Lake
  (Florida, USA), and Toolik Lake (Alaska, USA), which encompass a range
  of geographic location, trophic state, mixing regime, and watershed
  land use. The model representation of each lake has been simplified in
  multiple ways for the purpose of teaching this module: for example,
  lakes with multiple surface inflows were simplified to one inflow in
  the model.
</para>
          <para>
  Within the module, lake configuration files (glm2.nml) have been
  coarsely calibrated for each lake. Meteorological driver data
  (met_hourly.csv) for each lake were compiled at an hourly time step
  from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2;
  Cosgrove et al. 2003) and include air temperature, short and long wave
  radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation (rain and
  snow). For lakes that include a substantial surface inflow, an inflow
  file (inflow.csv) is included, which includes discharge volume, water
  temperature, and inflow salt concentration at a daily timestep. For
  lakes with a surface outflow, each lake model also includes a surface
  outflow file (outflow.csv) that is estimated based on inflows to
  maintain lake volume.
</para>
          <para>
  El Nino scenarios are estimated in the module based on long-term
  climate data. For each lake, historical climate data (annual mean,
  minimum, and maximum air temperatures; total annual rain and snow)
  were aggregated from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration National Climatic Data Center (NOAA NCDC) station
  nearest the lake, except for Toolik Lake, where data (annual mean air
  temperature) were obtained from the Toolik Environmental Data Center.
  Each year within the long-term data record was assigned as either El
  Nino, La Nina, or neutral years based on the Multivariate ENSO Index
  (MEI; available https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/).
