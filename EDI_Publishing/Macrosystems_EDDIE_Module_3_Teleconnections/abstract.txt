Ecosystems can be influenced by teleconnections, in which meteorological, societal, and/or ecological phenomenon link remote regions via cause and effect relationships. Because it is difficult to predict how ecosystems will respond to drivers from remote regions, many researchers are using models to simulate different teleconnection scenarios and see how ecosystems respond. For example, lake simulation models provide a powerful tool for exploring how lake thermal structure and ice cover respond to climate teleconnections such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

In this module, students will learn how to set up a lake model and "force" the model with climate scenarios to test hypotheses about how far-away drivers interact with local lake characteristics to affect lake temperatures and ice cover in different lakes. The overarching goal of this module is for students to explore new modeling and computing tools while learning fundamental concepts about how teleconnections affect lake temperatures and ice cover. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures.

This dataset contains instructional materials and the files necessary to run the complete module. Readers are referred to the GLM science manual (Hipsey et al. 2014; 2019) for further details on model configuration.
