Environmental phenomena are often driven by multiple factors that interact across space and over time. In freshwater lakes and reservoirs worldwide, carbon cycling and subsequent carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes are changing due to local, regional, and continental drivers. In this module, students will learn how to set up a lake model and "force" the model with climate scenarios to test hypotheses about how local and global drivers will interact to promote or suppress greenhouse gas fluxes in different lakes. The overarching goal of this module is for students to explore new modeling and computing tools while learning fundamental concepts about how non-linear macrosystem-level phenomena (e.g., lake greenhouse gas fluxes) can occur through macro-scale feedbacks. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures.
