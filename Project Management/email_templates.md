Recommended starter text for contacting Tier 1 testers for Macrosystems EDDIE

## Recruiting Tier 1 Testers
### "Integrating a Macrosystems EDDIE module into your course?" email
* This email is sent to potential Tier 1 faculty testers to gauge their interst in participating
* Ideally, this email is sent just prior to the start of the fall (e.g., August) or spring (January) semester
* Note that you need to change the items indicated in bold below, as well as updating the module description (indicated in italics below) before sending.

> Hi **TESTER_NAME**,

> **HELPER** and I just met to finalize our **SEMESTER** plan for Macrosystems EDDIE and were hoping to follow up with you in regards to teaching a module. Would you be interested in integrating a Macrosystems EDDIE module into your class and providing feedback on what worked well? 

> This upcoming **SEMESTER**, we are assessing “**MODULE NAME**” (Macrosystems EDDIE module **X**). *In this module, students choose a NEON or GLEON lake that we have pre-set up GLM models, and then the students use the model to see how water temperatures change in their lake in El Nino vs baseline years. This module was designed to be a bit shorter than our modules and focus on a general ecology audience.* All teaching materials are available on our website, here: https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/macrosystems/moduleX

> If you’re on board, the assessment would entail showing a 2-minute video introducing the project to your students as part of our IRB (Institutional Review Board) agreement, sending students links to pre-and post-assessment questions before and after you teach the module to test the module’s efficacy, and completing a brief faculty reflection to share your feedback). **HELPER** and I would of course work with you throughout the term to provide as much support as possible.  

> We look forward to working with you this year, and thank you for all of your support for Macrosystems EDDIE!

> Talk soon,  
> Cayelan and **HELPER**

## Communicating with confirmed Testers
### "Macrosystems EDDIE faculty tester details" email
* This email is sent soon after faculty have expressed interest in participating as a Tier 1 tester, to provide full details of what involvement entails
* Email provides links for faculty to fill out the course information form
* Note that you need to change **TESTER_NAME**, **MODULE NAME**, the "#" in the module web link, and **YOUR NAME** before sending.

> Hi **TESTER_NAME**-  
> I hope your semester is off to a great start!  

> Cayelan and I are excited for you to try **MODULE NAME** (http://module#.macrosystemseddie.org) with your class. Since you're on board, I wanted to go ahead and share our full official Faculty Tester details, so you'll have the list of to-do items as you prepare for your class. 

> We are committed to helping you integrate the module into your curriculum and classroom: as part of this, we wanted to give you an overview of what we were hoping for this year. Fortunately, Virginia Tech and Carleton College (our partners at the Science Education Resources Center (SERC), who are leading Macrosystems EDDIE's assessment) have IRB approval for the project so that you will not need to apply for IRB permission from your own institution. As part of our IRB agreement, we are asking you to:

> 1) Provide a brief description of your course (e.g., course name, number of students, etc.): so we can plan how best to help you during the semester. You can fill out that information via this form on the SERC website (http://tier1.macrosystemseddie.org).

> 2) Add a few sentences to your syllabus OR to the module student handout that reads, “Virginia Tech was awarded a federal grant to study curricula that introduce macrosystems ecology concepts to students. This new curricula is being used as part of this course. Pre and post student questionnaires are part of the curricula. These questionnaires are not graded but you can receive extra credit for completion. As part of understanding whether this curricula is useful for teaching students, a research project is investigating student responses. Your participation in the research aspect is not required to receive the extra credit. I, as the instructor, will only be able to tell that you have completed the questionnaires, not whether you have consented to have your responses included in the research project.”  (To incentivize participation in the pre- and post-assessment questions, I and many other Macrosystems EDDIE faculty offer a few extra credit points to students on midterm or homework grades; if you are not planning to offer extra credit in your classroom, that portion can be deleted).

> 3) Show a 2-minute video introducing the project to your students a few weeks before you teach the module: this video will introduce Macrosystems EDDIE and is available for download from our website (https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/macrosystems/recruitment_video). 

> 4) Send your students a link to the pre-assessment questions a week before you teach the module: all questionnaires will be online via a secure portal available through the SERC website that we will share with you. All student responses are anonymized in the SERC system. To match pre- and post- questionnaire responses, students will enter a university ID number before they enter their responses, as well as give consent to their responses being analyzed by our team. I will send you the links to your students' web-forms next week.

> 5) Teach the module! We are happy to answer any questions you may have as you prepare for classroom instruction. 

> 6) Send your students a link to the post-assessment questions after you teach the module. These post questions will largely mirror the pre-assessment questions, with a few additional questions soliciting their feedback on improvements that can be made to the module now that they have gone through it. 

> 7) Complete a brief faculty reflection in which you share any feedback on the module you may have after teaching the materials.

> This overview and relevant links to forms, the introductory video, etc. can also be viewed on our Faculty Resources webpage (faculty.macrosystemseddie.org)

> Again, we are super grateful for your assistance and recognize that faculty such as you are the foundation of our project! Please let me know if you have any questions about the project, and we look forward to working with you!

> All our best,  
> **YOUR NAME** & Cayelan

### "Macrosystems EDDIE pre-module reminders"  
* This email is used to share course-specific links with faculty testers about **two weeks** prior to the date they've indicated they will be teaching the module. 
* Note that you need to change **TESTER_NAME**, **MODULE NAME**, the "#" in the module web link, **YOUR NAME**, and the **class-specific consent and post-assessment links** before sending.

>Hi **TESTER_NAME**-   

> The semester is flying by and we're now just over two weeks out from your use of the Macrosystems EDDIE **MODULE NAME** module(!), so I wanted to send a few quick tip and reminders to help your use of the module go smoothly. Since we update materials frequently, please check that you have the latest versions of all the module files via http://module#.macrosystemseddie.org. If possible, we recommend you do a full run-through of the module in RStudio so that you're familiar with what students will be doing. If your students haven't had much (or any!) previous experience using R, you may also want to incorporate some of the slides from the "Getting Started" PowerPoint slides (available on the module website) into the Instructor's PowerPoint.  

> Also as a reminder, to help us comply with our IRB requirements, please share the introductory video in class with your students. The link to the video can be found on the Faculty Resources page.

> I am providing the links for your students to complete their consent and pre-module questionnaire, and the post-module questionnaire, which are pasted at the end of this email. We recommend sending the link to the pre-module questionnaire to students at least one week prior to the date you'll use the module in class (ideally 1-2 weeks beforehand), with subsequent reminders as needed. We recommend sending the link to the post-module questionnaire the day after completion of the module (the link will redirect to an error page until the day of the module). We ideally would like to have all assessments completed within one week of the module being taught.

> Finally, if you can send me a list of the ID numbers for students in your class, it will help streamline our data QA/QC with the SERC team and help me get student participation information back to you faster for providing extra credit. 

> Please be in touch with any questions you have as you're getting ready to teach the module, and thanks again for testing the module in your class! We look forward to hearing how it goes! 

> Thanks!   
**YOUR NAME** and Cayelan

> Text to use and/or modify to share module links with your students:  

> **Consent & Pre-Module Questionnaire**  
Dear students-

> Please use the following link to access the Macrosystems EDDIE consent form and pre-module questionnaire (https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/macrosystems/pilot/consent_LINK.html). It is important that you complete this questionnaire before we complete the module in class. In addition, after you complete the questionnaire, please try to work through the "R You Ready for EDDIE? " file to make sure you have the necessary programs on your computer to run the module. You will find the link to download this file at the bottom of the questionnaire page.

> Thank you!  

> **Post-Module Questionnaire**   
Dear students-

> Thank you for your enthusiasm during the Macrosystems EDDIE module. Please use the following link to access the post-module questionnaire (https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie/macrosystems/pilot/student_post-assess_mod2.html?cid=########). It is important that you complete this questionnaire within one week of today. If you have any feedback to improve the module, please feel free to include it in your questionnaire.

> Thank you!
