# Cross-Scale Interactions Module ####
 # This module was initially developed by Carey, C.C. and K.J. Farrell. 13 Aug. 2017.
 # Macrosystems EDDIE: Cross-Scale Interactions. Macrosystems EDDIE Module 2, Version 1. 
 # module2.macrosystemseddie.org
 # Module development was supported by NSF EF 1702506.

# R code for students to work through the module activities A, B, and C.
 # This module consists of 6 objectives. Activity A consists of Objectives 1-2,
 # Activity B consists of Objectives 3-4, & Activity C consists of Objectives 5-6.

########## ACTIVITY A - OBJECTIVE 1 ############################################
# Download R packages and GLM files onto your computer.

install.packages('sp') 
# NOTE: depending on your computer, you may get output  that says, "There is a 
  #  binary version available. Do you want to install from sources that need 
  #  compilation? y/n" If this pops up, type 'y' (without the quotes) and hit enter. 
  #  You may now be prompted to download the command line developer tools in a 
  #  pop-up window. Command line developer tools is a program used to run modeling 
  #  software. Click Install and then re-run install.packages(sp). This should 
  #  now successfully load- when it's done, it should say 'DONE(sp)' if it worked.

install.packages('devtools') 
# This is another R package used to run modeling software. If you get an error 
  #  message that says, "package ‘devtools’ is not available (for R version x.x.x)", 
  #  be sure to check that you are running the latest version of R

# Load the packages you just downloaded
library(sp) 
library(devtools)

Sys.setenv(R_INSTALL_STAGED = FALSE)
# This sets the environment variables for R version 3.6.0 

# Download the GLMr package. This may take a few minutes. 
devtools::install_github("CareyLabVT/GLMr") 
# If successful you should  see "DONE (GLMr)" at the end of the output.

# This step downloads the R packages that allow you to work with GLM in R. 
devtools::install_github("CareyLabVT/glmtools") 

# Load the two packages that you need to analyze GLM output
library(glmtools) 
  #  NOTE: you may get lots of output messages in red at this step- if it worked 
  #  successfully, you should read a lot of text that starts with: "This 
  #  information is preliminary or provisional..." 

library(GLMr) 
# If this worked, GLMr should load without error messages. Hooray!

# See what version of GLM you are running- should be v.2.x.x
glm_version() 

# CONGRATS! You've now succesfully loaded GLM onto your computer! 
  # Now, we will explore the files that come with your downloaded GLM files 

# NOTE! Throughout the rest of the module, you will need to modify some of the 
  #  lines of code to run on your computer. If you need to modify a line, I put 
  #  the symbols ##!! at the beginning of that line's annotation.  If you do not 
  #  see those symbols, you do not need to edit that line of code and can run it 
  #  as written.

# When working in R, we set the sim_folder to tell R where your files, scripts, 
  #  and model output are stored.  
# To find your folder path, navigate to the 'cross_scale_interactions' folder on 
  # your Desktop. Right click on the folder that matches your model lake 
  #  (Mendota or Sunapee), then select Properties (Windows) or Get Info (Mac). 
  #  Look under Location (Windows) or Where (Mac) to find your folder path 
  #  (examples below):
  #  Windows: C:/Users/KJF/Desktop/cross_scale_interactions/LakeName
  #  Mac: Users -> careylab -> Desktop -> cross_scale_interactions -> LakeName

##!! Edit this line to define the sim_folder location for your model lake. 
sim_folder <- '/Users/cayelan/Desktop/cross_scale_interactions/LakeName' 
  #  You will need to change the part after Users/ to give the name of your 
  #  computer (e.g., my computer name is cayelan, but yours will be different!) 
  #  AND change the word LakeName to be the name of your model lake (Mendota or Sunapee).

## This line of code is used to reset your working directory to the sim_folder. 
setwd(sim_folder) 
# The point of this step is to make sure that any new files you create (e.g., 
# figures of output) end up together in this folder.

# This step sets the nml_file for your simulation to be inside the sim_folder
nml_file <- paste0(sim_folder,"/glm2.nml") 

# Read in your nml file from your new directory
nml <- read_nml(nml_file) 

# This shows you what is in your nml file.  
print(nml) 
#  This is the 'master script' of the GLM simulation; the nml file tells the GLM 
  #  model all of the initial conditions about your lake, how you are defining 
  #  parameters, and more - this is a really important file! There should be 
  #  multiple sections, including glm_setup, morphometry, meteorology, etc.

# This command plots the meterological input data for the simulation:
plot_meteo(nml_file)  
# It includes short wave & long wave radiation, air temp, relative humidity, 
  #  etc. for the duration of the simulation. 
 
########## ACTIVITY A - OBJECTIVE 2 ############################################
# Now, the fun part- we get to run the model and look at output!

run_glm(sim_folder, verbose=TRUE) 
# So simple and elegant... if this works, you will see output that says 
  #  "Simulation begins..". At the end, it should say "Run complete" if 
  #  everything worked ok. This may take a few minutes.

# We need to know where the output data from your simulation (the output.nc file) 
  #  is so that the glmtools package can plot and analyze the model output. We tell 
  #  R where to find the output file using the line below:

# This says that the output.nc file is in the sim_folder.  
baseline <- file.path(sim_folder, 'output.nc') 

# This plots your simulated water temperatures in a heat map, where time is 
  #  displayed on the x-axis, lake depth is displayed on the y-axis, and the 
  #  different colors represent different temperatures. 
plot_temp(file=baseline, fig_path=FALSE) 

# To copy your plot (e.g., onto a PowerPoint slide), click "Export" within the 
  #  Plots tab. Then click "Copy to Clipboard", and click "Copy plot" in the preview 
  #  window. You can then paste your plot into Word, PowerPoint, etc. 

# If you want to save your plot as an image file or pdf file instead of copying 
  #  it, click "Export" within the Plots tab, then choose "Save as Image" or "Save 
  #  as PDF". In the preview window, give your plot a descriptive file name (e.g., 
  #  "TemperatureHeatMap.pdf"), then press "Save". Your plot image and/or PDF file 
  #  will be saved in the sim_folder on your Desktop.

# Note that if you want to save plots, you should copy and paste them as you go!

# This pair of commands can be used to list the variables that were output as part 
  #  of your GLM run.
var_names <- sim_vars(baseline)
print(var_names) 

# We are particularly interested in the amount of total chlorophyll-a (chl-a), 
  #  because that is related to phytoplankton blooms. The variable name for chl-a 
  #  is "PHY_TCHLA", and it is reported in units of micrograms per liter of water 
  #  (ug/L). Search through the list of variables to find PHY_TCHLA.

# Use the code below to create a heatmap of chl-a in the lake over time. 
plot_var(file = baseline, "PHY_TCHLA") 
# What do you notice about seasonal patterns in chl-a? 

# We also want to save the model output of the daily chlorophyll-a concentrations 
  #  in the lake during our baseline simulation, because we'll be comparing it to 
  #  our climate and land use scenarios later.  To do this, we use the following 
  #  commands:

# Save the chl-a from the surface only:
chla_output <- get_var(file=baseline, "PHY_TCHLA", reference='surface', z_out=c(1)) 
colnames(chla_output)[2] <- "Baseline_Chla" 
# Here we rename the chl-a column so we remember it is from the Baseline scenario

# We'll also use the command below to save a copy of our output as a .csv file:
write.csv(chla_output, './model_output.csv', quote=F, row.names = F)

########## ACTIVITY B - OBJECTIVE 3 ############################################
# For Activity B, you will work with your partner to model your lake, plus another 
  #  team that is modeling another lake. With your partner and another team, select
  #  one of the pre-made climate scenarios. Remember that both teams should run the 
  #  SAME climate scenario on their separate lakes and compare the output.

##!!!! Once you have selected your climate scenario, you need to edit the glm2.nml 
  #  file to change the name of the input met file so that it reads in the met 
  #  data for your climate scenario, not the default 'met_hourly.csv'.  

##!!!! Open the .nml file by clicking 'glm2.nml' in the Files tab of RStudio, 
  #  then scroll down to the meteorology section, and change the 'meteo_fl' entry 
  #  to the new met file name (e.g., from 'met_hourly.csv' to 'met_hourly_plus2.csv'). 

##!!!! SAVE your modified glm2.nml file.

# Once you have edited the nml file name, you should check to make sure that 
  #  it is correct with the following commandS:
nml <- read_nml(nml_file)   
get_nml_value(nml, 'meteo_fl') 
##!! The printout here should list your NEW meteorological file for your climate 
  # scenario. If it doesn't, make sure you pressed the Save icon (the floppy disk)
  # after you changed your glm2.nml file.

# You can now run the model for your climate change scenario using the new edited 
  # nml file using the commands below. Exciting!

# Run your GLM model for your lake climate scenario. 
run_glm(sim_folder, verbose=TRUE) 

# Again, we need to tell R where the output.nc file is so that the glmtools package 
  #  can plot and analyze the model output. We tell R where to find the output file 
  #  using the line below:
climate <- file.path(sim_folder, 'output.nc') 
# This defines the output.nc file as being within the sim_folder. Note that we've 
  #  called this output "climate" since it is output from our climate change simulation.

# As before, we want to save the model output of the daily chlorophyll-a 
  #  concentrations in the lake during our climate change simulation, to compare to 
  #  our baseline and land use scenarios later. 

#  Extract surface chl-a:
climate_chla <- get_var(file=climate, "PHY_TCHLA", reference='surface', z_out=c(1)) 
chla_output["Climate_Chla"] <- climate_chla[2] 
# Here we attach the chl-a data from your climate simulation to the same file that 
  #  contains your baseline scenario chl-a concentrations. 

# Again, we'll use the command below to save a copy of our output as a .csv file:
write.csv(chla_output, './model_output.csv', quote=F, row.names = F)

##!! To check that your climate change scenario ran correctly, run the command 
  #  below, and compare the chl-a data between your baseline and climate scenarios. 
  #  They'll likely be similar, but if they're EXACTLY the same after the first 
  #  few rows, something might have gone wrong in setting up your climate scenario 
  #  (likely with changing the glm2.nml file!)
View(chla_output)

########## ACTIVITY B - OBJECTIVE 4 ############################################
# Plot the output using the commands you learned above. 
# Create a heatmap of the water temperature
plot_temp(file=climate, fig_path=FALSE) 
  # How does this compare to your baseline?
# Note: If you want to control the maximum value of the color scale on your heatmaps, 
  # add the following (without quotes) after fig_path=FALSE: 'col_lim= c(0,35)'
  # This tells R that you want your maximum value to be 35, and your min. to be 0

# Create a heatmap of chlorophyll-a. 
plot_var(file=climate, "PHY_TCHLA") 
# How does this compare to your baseline? You can add the 'col_lim' command to 
  #  this plot, too! Look at the Note from the plot_temp() command to learn how.

# Do these plots from the climate scenario and the baseline support or contradict 
  # your hypotheses about climate change effects on chlorophyll-a? 

########## ACTIVITY C - OBJECTIVE 5 ############################################
# Now, with your partner and the other team, select one of the pre-made land use 
  #  scenarios based on changes in phosphorus concentrations in the inflow file. 
  #  Remember that both teams should run the SAME land use scenario on their separate 
  #  lakes and compare the output.

##!!!! Once you have selected your land use scenario, you need to edit the glm2.nml 
  #  file to change the name of the inflow file so that it reads in the inflow file 
  #  for your land use scenario, not the default "inflow.csv".  

##!!!! Open the glm2.nml file, scroll down to the inflows section, and change the 
  #  inflow_fl entry to the new file name (e.g., from 'inflow.csv' to 'inflow_fourP.csv'). 

##!!!! IMPORTANT: Be sure to ALSO change your met file name in the glm2.nml BACK to 
  # the original (baseline) met file (e.g., in the meteorology section, make sure 
  # your 'meteo_fl' entry is 'met_hourly.csv'. This is because we want 
  # to examine the effects of your land use scenario SEPARATE from the climate
  # scenario you developed earlier. \\

##!!!! Save your modified glm2.nml file that has baseline meteorology and altered 
  #  land use.

# Once you have edited the nml file name, check to make sure that it is correct 
  # with the commands:
nml <- read_nml(nml_file)  
get_nml_value(nml, 'inflow_fl') 
# You should get an output that lists the name of your ALTERED inflow file.
get_nml_value(nml, 'meteo_fl') 
# You should get an output that lists the name of your BASELINE meteorological 
  #  file ('met_hourly.csv').

# You can now run the model for your land use scenario using the new edited 
  #  nml file using the commands below. Exciting!

# Run your GLM model for your lake land use scenario. 
run_glm(sim_folder, verbose=TRUE) 
  # At the end of the model run, it should say "Run complete" if everything worked.

# Again, we need to tell R where the output.nc file is so that the glmtools package 
  #  can plot and analyze the model output. We tell R where to find the output file 
  #  using the line below:
landuse <- file.path(sim_folder, 'output.nc') 
# This defines the output.nc file as being within the sim_folder. Note that we've 
  #  called this output "landuse" since it is output from our land use change simulation.

# As before, we want to save the model output of the daily chlorophyll-a 
  #  concentrations in the lake during our land use change simulation, to compare 
  #  to our baseline and climate scenarios later. 
# Extract surface chl-a:
landuse_chla <- get_var(file=landuse, "PHY_TCHLA", reference='surface', z_out=c(1)) 
chla_output["LandUse_Chla"] <- landuse_chla[2] 
# Here we attach the chl-a data from your land  use simulation to the same file 
  #  that contains your baseline and climate change scenario chl-a concentrations.

# Again, we'll use the command below to save a copy of our output as a .csv file:
write.csv(chla_output, './model_output.csv', quote=F, row.names = F)

# Plot the output of your land use scenario using the commands you learned above. 
plot_var(file=landuse, "PHY_TCHLA") 
# How does your phytoplankton heatmap look in comparison to the baseline? 
# Be sure to check the scale of the color gradient for chl-a when comparing plots!

# Finally, we want to see what happens when land use and climate interact! 
  #  Luckily, testing the combined effects of your land use and climate change 
  #  scenarios will be pretty easy! Since we already have modified met data 
  #  (climate scenario) and inflow data (land use scenario), we just have GLM read 
  #  them both at once. We can do this by changing the glm2.nml file to include our 
  #  modified files.

##!!!! In the glm2.nml file, make the following TWO changes:

##!!!! 1) In the meteorology section, change the 'meteo_fl' entry to the met file 
  #  that represents your climate change scenario (e.g., 'met_hourly_plus2.csv')

##!!!! 2) In the inflow section, check that the 'inflow_fl' file represents your 
  #  land use change scenario (e.g., 'inflow_fourP.csv')

##!!!! Save your glm2.nml file, then run the following commands to check that the 
#  changes were made correctly.
# Read in your updated nml file 
nml <- read_nml(nml_file) 
get_nml_value(nml, 'inflow_fl') 
# If you have done this correctly, your output should list the name of your 
  #  ALTERED inflow file.
get_nml_value(nml, 'meteo_fl') 
# If you have done this correctly, your output should list the name of your 
  #  ALTERED meteorological file.

# Run GLM one more time for your lake climate + land use scenario!
run_glm(sim_folder, verbose=TRUE)

# As above, we need to tell R where the output.nc file is:
climate_landuse <- file.path(sim_folder, 'output.nc') 
# This defines the output.nc file as being within the sim_folder. Note that we've 
  #  called this output "climate_landuse" since it is the output from our 
  #  simultaneous climate AND land use change simulations.

# As before, we want to save the model output of the daily chlorophyll-a 
  #  concentrations in the lake, to compare to our baseline, climate, and land use 
  #  scenarios. 
# Extract surface chl-a:
combined_chla <- get_var(file=climate_landuse, "PHY_TCHLA", reference='surface', z_out=c(1)) 
chla_output["Climate_LandUse_Chla"] <- combined_chla[2] 
# Here we attach the chl-a data from  your combined simulation to the same file 
  # that contains your baseline, climate change, & land use scenario chl-a concentrations

# Once more, we'll use the command below to save a copy of our output as a .csv file:
write.csv(chla_output, './model_output.csv', quote=F, row.names = F)
# Now there is a .csv file named "model_output.csv" saved in your lake's folder!

# Plot the output of your land use scenario using the commands you learned above. 
plot_var(file=climate_landuse, "PHY_TCHLA") 

# Now that you've run four different scenarios (baseline, climate only, land use 
  #  only, and climate + land use), let's plot how the chl-a in the lakes responded 
  #  to the different scenarios. We can do this by:

# The command below plots DateTime vs. Observed data in black: 
plot(chla_output$DateTime, chla_output$Baseline_Chla, type="l", lwd=2, col="black", 
     ylab="Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)", xlab="Date", ylim=c(0, 100))  

# add an orange line of the climate change scenario
lines(chla_output$DateTime, chla_output$Climate_Chla, lwd=2, col="darkorange")

# add a blue line of the land use scenario
lines(chla_output$DateTime, chla_output$LandUse_Chla, lwd=2, col="deepskyblue") 

# add a green line of the climate + land use scenario
lines(chla_output$DateTime, chla_output$Climate_LandUse_Chla, lwd=2, col="springgreen4") 

# add a legend
legend("topleft",c("Baseline", "Climate Only", "Land Use Only", "Combined C + LU"),  
       lty=1, lwd=2, col=c("black","darkorange","deepskyblue", "springgreen4"))

##!! Note that the command ylim=c(0, 100) tells R what you want the minimum and 
  #  maximum values on the y-axis to be (here, we're plotting from 0 to 100 ug/L). 
##!! You should adjust this range to make sure all your data are shown in the 
  #  plot.

########## ACTIVITY C - OBJECTIVE 6 ############################################
# Using the line plot you just created, and the other team's line plot from their 
  #  lake, put together a brief presentation of your model simulation and output to 
  #  share with the rest of the class (you'll present as a group of 4!)

# Make sure your presentation answers the questions listed in your handout.

# Bravo, you are done!! 

# We welcome feedback on this module and encourage you to provide comments, 
  #  questions, and suggestions. Please visit our website (http://MacrosystemsEDDIE.org) 
  #  to submit feedback to the module developers.
